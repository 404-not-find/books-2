# Contribution Guidelines
Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
- Search included books before adding a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Every workflow addition should follow the same format.
	1. The book should be put into its appropriate category (Pick the one you think is closest if you are not sure).
	2. If the book is free, link to the free book. If the book is not free, link to the book on [Goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/)
- Check your spelling and grammar.
