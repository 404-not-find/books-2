# Contribution Guidelines
Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
- Search included books before adding a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Every book addition should follow the same format.
	1. The book should be put into its appropriate category (Pick the one you think is closest if you are not sure).
	2. If the book is free, link to the free book. If the book is not free, link to the book on [Goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/)
	3. Add appropriate emoji. If the book is free add ðŸ“– before the name. If it is not, add ðŸ“•.
- If you want to add a link to notes for the book, add it below the book as subdashed point.
- Please add a short description of the book after the book name where it is appropriate.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- You can also add other related websites and repositories in the end.
