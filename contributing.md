Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Use the following format: `<ðŸ“• or ðŸ“–> [Name](link) (Year) - Description.`
- Adding the Year is optional but is advised.
- If the book is free, link to the free book and add ðŸ“– emoji.
- If the book is not free, link to the book on [Goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/) and add ðŸ“• emoji.
- The book should be put into its appropriate category (Pick the one you think is closest if you are not sure).
- If you want to add a link to notes for the book, add it below the book as subdashed point.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorisation are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
